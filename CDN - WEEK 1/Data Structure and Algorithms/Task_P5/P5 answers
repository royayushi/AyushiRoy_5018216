Understand Linked Lists

Types of Linked Lists:

Singly Linked List:

Each node contains data and a reference to the next node.
Operations (e.g., insertion, deletion) are typically done by traversing the list from the head node.

Structure:

Head -> Node1 -> Node2 -> ... -> NodeN -> null

Doubly Linked List:

Each node contains data, a reference to the next node, and a reference to the previous node.
More flexible than singly linked lists but requires more memory due to the extra reference.

Structure:

Head <-> Node1 <-> Node2 <-> ... <-> NodeN <-> null

Analysis

Time Complexity:

Add: O(n) - Inserting an element at the end requires traversing the list to find the last node.
Search: O(n) - Searching requires traversing the list until the element is found or the end is reached.
Traverse: O(n) - Traversing requires visiting each node once.
Delete: O(n) - Deleting requires searching for the element and then removing it, which involves traversing the list.

Advantages of Linked Lists over Arrays for Dynamic Data:

Dynamic Size: Linked lists can grow or shrink in size dynamically, unlike arrays which have a fixed size.
Efficient Insertions/Deletions: Inserting or deleting elements in the middle of a 
linked list is more efficient than in arrays, as it does not require shifting elements.
Memory Usage: Linked lists use memory efficiently for sparse data, whereas arrays may waste memory if not fully utilized.

Limitations of Linked Lists:

Memory Overhead: Each node in a linked list requires extra memory for storing the reference to the next node.
Sequential Access: Linked lists do not support random access; elements must be accessed 
sequentially, which can be slower compared to arrays.
Cache Performance: Linked lists may have poor cache performance due to non-contiguous memory allocation.

By using linked lists, dynamic data can be managed more efficiently, 
especially when the size of the data set changes frequently and insertions and deletions are common.

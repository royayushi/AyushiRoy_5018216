Understand Sorting Algorithms

Sorting Algorithms:

Bubble Sort:

Simple comparison-based algorithm.
Repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
Time Complexity: O(n^2) in the worst and average cases, O(n) in the best case (when the array is already sorted).

Insertion Sort:

Builds the final sorted array one item at a time.
Picks the next element and places it in the correct position within the already sorted portion of the array.
Time Complexity: O(n^2) in the worst and average cases, O(n) in the best case.

Quick Sort:

Divide-and-conquer algorithm.
Picks a 'pivot' element, partitions the array into two sub-arrays (elements less than the pivot 
and elements greater than the pivot), and recursively sorts the sub-arrays.
Time Complexity: O(n log n) on average, O(n^2) in the worst case (but this is rare).

Merge Sort:

Divide-and-conquer algorithm.
Divides the array into two halves, recursively sorts each half, and then merges the two sorted halves.
Time Complexity: O(n log n) in all cases (best, average, and worst).

Analysis

Time Complexity:

Bubble Sort:

Best Case: O(n)
Average Case: O(n^2)
Worst Case: O(n^2)

Quick Sort:

Best Case: O(n log n)
Average Case: O(n log n)
Worst Case: O(n^2) (rare, typically mitigated by choosing a good pivot)

Why Quick Sort is Generally Preferred Over Bubble Sort:

Efficiency: Quick Sort has a significantly better average-case time complexity (O(n log n)) compared to Bubble Sort (O(n^2)).

Scalability: Quick Sort performs much better on large datasets due to its divide-and-conquer approach.

Practical Performance: Even though the worst-case complexity of Quick Sort is O(n^2), this is rare 
and can be mitigated with good pivot selection. 
In practice, Quick Sort is one of the fastest sorting algorithms for a wide range of inputs.

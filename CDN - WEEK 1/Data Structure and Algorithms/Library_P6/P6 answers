Understand Search Algorithms

Linear Search:

Linear search algorithm checks each element in the data set sequentially until the desired element is 
found or the end of the data set is reached.
Time Complexity: O(n) in the worst case.
Usage: Effective for small or unsorted data sets.

Binary Search:

Binary search algorithm repeatedly divides the sorted data set in half to locate the desired element.
Time Complexity: O(log n) in the worst case.
Usage: Requires the data set to be sorted and is more efficient for large data sets.

Analysis

Time Complexity Comparison:

Linear Search:

Best Case: O(1) - The item is found at the first position.
Average Case: O(n) - The item is somewhere in the middle.
Worst Case: O(n) - The item is at the last position or not present at all.

Binary Search:

Best Case: O(1) - The item is at the middle position.
Average Case: O(log n) - The item is found after several halving steps.
Worst Case: O(log n) - The item is not present, requiring maximum halving steps.

When to Use Each Algorithm:

Linear Search:

Used for small or unsorted data sets.
Simple to implement and does not require sorting.
Suitable when the overhead of sorting is not justified by the number of searches.

Binary Search:

Used for large, sorted data sets.
More efficient than linear search for large data sets due to its logarithmic time complexity.
Requires additional overhead to keep the data set sorted.

Linear search is straightforward and effective for smaller or unsorted data, 
while binary search is much faster for large, sorted data sets.

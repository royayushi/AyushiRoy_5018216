Understand Array Representation

Array Representation in Memory:

Arrays are a collection of elements stored in contiguous memory locations.
Each element in the array is identified by an index.
Arrays allow for constant-time access (O(1)) to elements if the index is known.
Arrays have a fixed size, determined at the time of creation.

Advantages:

Fast Access: Constant-time access to elements using the index.
Memory Efficient: Low overhead as elements are stored in contiguous memory.
Simple Data Structure: Easy to understand and implement.

Analysis

Time Complexity:

Add: O(1) - Adding an element to the end of the array.
Search: O(n) - Linear search through the array.
Traverse: O(n) - Iterating through the array.
Delete: O(n) - Searching for the element and shifting subsequent elements.

Limitations of Arrays:

Fixed Size: The size of the array is fixed at creation, which can lead to wasted space or the need for resizing.
Inefficient Insertions and Deletions: Adding or removing elements (other than at the end) requires shifting elements, which is O(n).
Linear Search: Searching requires O(n) time in the worst case.

When to Use Arrays:

When fast access to elements using an index is needed.
When the size of the data set is known and fixed.
When insertion and deletion operations are infrequent.

In cases where dynamic resizing or more efficient insertions/deletions are required, some other data structures like 
linked lists or dynamic arrays (e.g., ArrayList in Java) are being used.

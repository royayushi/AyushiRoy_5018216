Understand Recursive Algorithms

Concept of Recursion:

Recursion is a technique where a function calls itself to solve a smaller instance of the same problem.
It simplifies problems by breaking them down into smaller subproblems until a base case is reached.
Example: Calculating the factorial of a number, where n! = n * (n-1)!.

Analysis

Time Complexity:

The time complexity of the recursive algorithm is O(n), where n is the number of periods.
Each recursive call processes one period until the base case (periods = 0) is reached.

Optimization:

Memoization: Stores the results of previously computed values to avoid redundant calculations.
Iterative Approach: Converts the recursive algorithm to an iterative one to avoid the overhead of recursive calls.

Advantages of Optimization:

Memoization: Reduces redundant calculations, thus saving time and computational resources.
Iterative Approach: Avoids the overhead of recursive calls and stack usage, making it more efficient for larger inputs.

Understand Asymptotic Notation

Big O Notation:

Big O notation is used to describe the upper bound of an algorithm's running time. It gives us an idea of the 
worst-case scenario in terms of performance and helps us compare the efficiency of different algorithms. 
It focuses on the growth rate of an algorithm's time complexity as the input size increases.

Best, Average, and Worst-Case Scenarios:

Best Case: The scenario where the algorithm performs the minimum number of operations.

Average Case: The scenario where the algorithm performs an average number of operations.

Worst Case: The scenario where the algorithm performs the maximum number of operations.

Time Complexity Comparison:

Linear Search:

Best Case: O(1) - The item is found at the first position.
Average Case: O(n) - The item is somewhere in the middle.
Worst Case: O(n) - The item is at the last position or not present at all.

Binary Search:

Best Case: O(1) - The item is at the middle position.
Average Case: O(log n) - The item is found after several halving steps.
Worst Case: O(log n) - The item is not present, requiring maximum halving steps.

Which Algorithm is More Suitable?

Linear Search is simple and does not require the array to be sorted.
It is suitable for small datasets or unsorted data.

Binary Search is much faster for large, sorted datasets due to its O(log n) time complexity.
It is more suitable for platforms where search speed is critical and the data can be maintained in a sorted order.

For an e-commerce platform with potentially large amounts of product data, binary search is generally more
suitable due to its better time complexity.
